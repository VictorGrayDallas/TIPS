This is a university project. The project is an Android app for tracking financial expenses. Users can enter expenses with information for amount, date, description, and category, with the option to make automatically recurring expenses with a custom frequency. It also generates reports displaying expenses over customizable time periods, on a per-category basis.

The app is programmed in C# using MAUI, Microsoft's platform for mobile app development. This was my first time using MAUI.
